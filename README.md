# av-rca
Welcome to the av-rca wiki!

These scripts are adapted from the SVNDL lab's rcaExtra analysis pipeline. You will need that repository in addition to this one for these scripts to work.

This repo is currently structured with two folders: main_RCA, which contains the scripts to do RCA analysis trained on odd, even, and all harmonics of a dataset, and 'supplemental', which will contain additional scripts needed for analysis, such as running correlations between RCs.
